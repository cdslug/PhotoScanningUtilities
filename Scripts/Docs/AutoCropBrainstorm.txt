Auto Cropper Plan

### Assumptions ###
A desired photo is not completely black
A photo may have a black border
A photo is a rectangle with straight edges

### Tests ###
Test whether I can auto crop on a thumbnail

### CONFIG ###
average border pixel value
std border pixel value
auto rotate
overcrop percent

### Requirements ###
log file with calculated rotation angle for each side of photo

### Implementation ###
2 recursive functions
	find horizontal edges
	find vertical edges
	These might be the same function with an input flag

--- Function ---
def FindEdges
	Input: Indices of search area
	Output: set of Indices indicating border (angles?)
	Description:
		Start with a crude estimate by looking at middle of original photo.
		Get 4 points for top, bottom, left, right
		Use these to check for the border close the the adjacent edge
	Corner Cases:
		What about if a photo is rotated 45 degrees?

		divide and

--- Function ---
def CheckBlackBorder
	input: index to check
	output: boolean
	Description: Decides if pixel is black enough to be a border. Does not mean it is a border pixel
		Check against the average black +- constant * std
